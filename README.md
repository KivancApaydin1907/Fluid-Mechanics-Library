**Engineering Utilities Library** developed by *Kıvanç Apaydın*.

This repository serves as a centralized collection of C++ numerical tools developed for Aeronautical Engineering applications. It focuses on automating complex calculations for Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Aerodynamics, and Hydraulic Systems.

## 📂 Available Modules

| Module | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Boundary Layer Inflation](./Boundary-Layer)** | Calculates geometric growth ratios for CFD meshing ($y^+$ control) using the Bisection Method. | ✅ Stable |
| **[Hydraulic Pipe Flow](./Pipe-Flow)** | Solves the Colebrook-White equation to determine pressure drop and head loss in internal flows. | ✅ Stable |
| **[Tank Sloshing Analysis](./Tank-Acceleration)** | Analyzes free-surface deformation under linear and rotational acceleration. | ✅ Stable |

## 📜 Project History

> *These tools were originally developed during the author's undergraduate studies for Fluid Dynamics and Aerodynamics courses (2023-2024). They have been refactored, modernized, and consolidated into this library by AI assistants under the author's supervision to meet professional open-source standards.*
